## Introduction

The "Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logics" course provides an in-depth understanding of artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic systems, and their applications. This repository serves as a practical resource for implementing and experimenting with the algorithms and techniques learned in the course.

## Codes

The repository includes the following MATLAB codes:

1. **ANFIS_Modelling.m**: Implements the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) algorithm for modeling and prediction tasks.
2. **TriangularMF.m**: Plots a triangular membership function.
3. **TrapezoidalMF.m**: Plots a trapezoidal membership function.
4. **MultipleMF.m**: Plots multiple membership functions on the same graph.
5. **ZadehDiagram.m**: Generates a Zadeh diagram for a fuzzy set and its "very" complement.

## Requirements

To run the MATLAB codes in this repository, you need to have MATLAB installed on your system. The codes were developed and tested using MATLAB version [insert your MATLAB version here].

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/neural-networks-fuzzy-logics.git

2. Navigate to the cloned repository directory:
cd neural-networks-fuzzy-logics

3. Open MATLAB and navigate to the repository directory.
4. Run the desired MATLAB script by typing the file name in the MATLAB command window (e.g., `TriangularMF`).
