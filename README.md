## Introduction

The "Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logics" course provides an in-depth understanding of artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic systems, and their applications. This repository serves as a practical resource for implementing and experimenting with the algorithms and techniques learned in the course.

## Codes

The repository includes the following MATLAB codes:

1. **BAM_Algorithm.m**: Implements the BAM (Bi-directional Associative Memory) algorithm.
2. **Activation_Functions.m**: Contains various activation functions used in neural networks, such as tansig, logsig, poslin, purelin, and softmax.
3. **BPN_Industrial_Datasets.m**: Trains a neural network with industrial datasets using the scaled conjugate gradient algorithm.
4. **Ex1_tansig.m**: Calculates the output of a simple neuron using the 'tansig' activation function.
5. **Ex2_logsig.m**: Calculates the output of a simple neuron using the 'logsig' activation function.
6. **Ex3_plot_tansig_logsig.m**: Plots the 'tansig' and 'logsig' activation functions.
7. **Ex4_plot_poslin_purelin.m**: Plots the 'poslin' and 'purelin' activation functions.
8. **Ex5_softmax.m**: Implements the softmax function.
9. **Ex6_activation_functions.m**: Illustrates various activation functions used in neural networks.
10. **Ex7_train_NN_datasets.m**: Trains a neural network with datasets using various algorithms (trainlm, traingd, trainscg).
11. **SOM_Algorithm.m**: Implements the SOM (Self-Organizing Map) algorithm.
